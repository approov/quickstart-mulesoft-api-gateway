# APPROOV QUICKSTART - MULESOFT API GATEWAY

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your API services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.

This repo implements the Approov API request verification for the [Mulesoft API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), which performs the verification check on the Approov Token before allowing valid traffic to reach the API endpoint.

## Why?

You can learn more about Approov, the motives for adopting it, and more detail on how it works by following this [link](https://approov.io/product). In brief, Approov:

* Ensures that accesses to your API come from official versions of your apps; it blocks accesses from republished, modified, or tampered versions
* Protects the sensitive data behind your API; it prevents direct API abuse from bots or scripts scraping data and other malicious activity
* Secures the communication channel between your app and your API with [Approov Dynamic Certificate Pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning). This has all the benefits of traditional pinning but without the drawbacks
* Removes the need for an API key in the mobile app
* Provides DoS protection against targeted attacks that aim to exhaust the API server resources to prevent real users from reaching the service or to at least degrade the user experience.

## How it works?

This is a brief overview of how the Approov cloud service and the Mulesoft API Gateway fit together from a backend perspective. For a complete overview of how the mobile app and backend fit together with the Approov cloud service and the Approov SDK we recommend that you read the [Approov overview](https://approov.io/product) page on our website.

### Approov Cloud Service

The Approov cloud service attests that a device is running a legitimate and tamper-free version of your mobile app.

* If the integrity check passes then a valid token is returned to the mobile app
* If the integrity check fails then a legitimate looking token will be returned

In either case, the app, unaware of the token's validity, adds it to every request it makes to Approov protected API(s).

### Mulesoft API Gateway

This quick start shows you how to setup Mulesoft API Gateway to ensure that the token supplied in the `Approov-Token` header is present and valid. The validation is done by using the public key associated with the private key used to sign the valid Approov tokens. This private key is never shared with the backend or mobile app, and in fact the Approov cloud service doesn't have any mechanism for you to obtain it.

The request is handled such that:

* If the Approov Token is valid, the request is allowed to reach the API endpoint
* If the Approov Token is invalid, an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response is returned
* If the Approov Token is missing, an HTTP 400 Bad Request response is returned

## Approov Integration Quickstart

The quickstart for the Approov integration with the Mulesoft API Gateway gets you up and running with basic Approov token checking:

* [Approov token check quickstart](/docs/APPROOV_TOKEN_QUICKSTART.md)

Please bear in mind that the quickstart assumes that you already have an Mulesoft API Gateway running, and that you are familiar with the options for applying changes. If you are not familiar with the Mulesoft API Gateway then you may want to follow the step by step [Mulesoft API Gateway Example](/docs/MULESOFT_API_GATEWAY_EXAMPLE.md) instead. This takes you though all the steps to get a new deployment with Approov protection from scratch.
